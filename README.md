# JavaPythonPrint
Ever wanted to use print() in Java? Well now you can. Simply copy and paste the methods in `Util.java` into your class and boom!
Welcome back to the modern age, where you only have to write 5 characters to print instead of 18. It's also conveniently 
formatted in Python-style Java, which includes PEP 8-compliant docstrings.

DISCLAIMER: This code only supports `print()` calls of up to 64 arguments. If you're using more arguments than that, read up
on the Single Responsibility Principle and clean code!
